# Test Plan: Smart Library with AI

This document outlines the test plan for the Smart Library with AI system, based on the provided Technical Design Document. It details the testing scope, objectives, and approach.

## 1. Introduction

This test plan provides a comprehensive strategy for testing the Smart Library with AI system. It ensures that all functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet the defined requirements.

## 2. Test Objectives

The main objectives of this test plan are:

* Verify the functionality of all API endpoints
* Ensure the correct integration of AI services
* Validate the frontend user interfaces and components
* Confirm database operations and relationships
* Test non-functional requirements such as performance, security, and usability

## 3. Scope of Testing

The testing will cover the following areas:

* Backend API testing (Laravel)
* Frontend UI testing (Nuxt.js + Tailwind CSS)
* Database testing (MySQL)
* AI service integration testing
* Performance testing
* Security testing
* Usability testing

## 4. Testing Approach

### 4.1 Backend Testing (Laravel)

* Use PHPUnit for API testing
* Write unit tests for models and controllers
* Test each API endpoint with various inputs and expected outputs

#### API Endpoint Test Cases

| Endpoint | Method | Test Cases |
|----------|--------|------------|
| /api/books | GET | Test retrieving all books |
| /api/books/{id} | GET | Test retrieving specific book details |
| /api/books | POST | Test adding new books |
| /api/books/{id} | PUT | Test updating book information |
| /api/books/{id} | DELETE | Test deleting books |
| /api/search | GET | Test search functionality |
| /api/borrowings | GET | Test retrieving borrowing records |
| /api/borrowings | POST | Test creating new borrowing records |
| /api/chatbot | POST | Test chatbot functionality |
| /api/register | POST | Test user registration |
| /api/login | POST | Test user authentication |

### 4.2 Frontend Testing (Nuxt.js + Tailwind CSS)

* Use Jest and Vue Test Utils for component testing
* Test each page and component for functionality and responsiveness
* Verify styling and layout consistency with Tailwind CSS

#### Frontend Page Test Cases

| Page | Test Cases |
|------|------------|
| Home | Test search bar and featured books |
| Book Details | Test book information display |
| Search Results | Test search functionality and results display |
| User Profile | Test user information display and editing |
| Borrowing History | Test borrowing records display |
| Admin Dashboard | Test librarian-specific features |

### 4.3 Database Testing (MySQL)

* Verify data integrity and consistency
* Test database relationships and constraints
* Check for data retrieval and storage accuracy

#### Database Table Test Cases

| Table | Test Cases |
|-------|------------|
| books | Test CRUD operations |
| users | Test user data management |
| borrowings | Test borrowing records management |

### 4.4 AI Integration Testing

* Test AI-powered search functionality
* Validate recommendation algorithms
* Test chatbot NLP responses

### 4.5 Performance Testing

* Test API response times
* Measure page load times
* Check system performance under load

### 4.6 Security Testing

* Test authentication and authorization for API endpoints
* Verify data encryption and protection of user data

### 4.7 Usability Testing

* Evaluate user interfaces for ease of use and navigation
* Gather user feedback on usability and functionality

## 5. Test Environment

* Development environment for initial testing
* Staging environment for integration testing
* Production-like environment for performance and security testing

## 6. Test Deliverables

* Test cases document
* Test reports
* Defect tracking report

## 7. Test Schedule

* Week 1-2: Unit testing
* Week 3-4: Integration testing
* Week 5: System testing
* Week 6: Performance testing
* Week 7: Security testing

## 8. Conclusion

This test plan ensures a comprehensive testing strategy for the Smart Library with AI system. By following this plan, we can ensure the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements.
